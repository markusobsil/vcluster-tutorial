# Lab 3 - Fake and Real Nodes

## Overview

This lab is all about Kubernetes nodes. After completing this lab, you should
be able to answer the following questions:

* What are *Fake Nodes*?
* What are *Real Nodes*?
* What are *Node Label Selectors* used for?

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are the same as in [Lab 1](../lab1/README.md).

## Create a kind cluster

You find the kind configuration for this lab [here](kind-config-vcluster-lab-3.yaml).

```bash
kind create cluster --config kind-config-vcluster-lab-3.yaml
```
```

Set kubectl context to "kind-vcluster-host"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-vcluster-host

Have a nice day! üëã
```

After creating the kind cluster, your kube config context should automatically
switch to the new kind cluster. If you are not using a kind cluster, please
change the context to your host cluster.

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```
```
kind-vcluster-host
```

## Fake Nodes

*Fake Nodes* are the default in vcluster. When using *Fake Nodes* a node will
be created for each `spec.nodeName` encountered in a `Pod` definition. Why is
this the default?

As reading the node information from the Kube API on the host cluster is a
privileged operation, RBAC configuration would need to be in place to allow
vcluster (eg the `syncer`) to read that information.

Once the last `Pod` is removed from a *Fake Node* the node will be deleted.

### Create a vcluster

```bash
vcluster create fake-nodes
```

### Questions

1. How many nodes are in your Kind cluster?
2. How many nodes are in your vcluster?
3. What is the difference between a node in the Kind and the vcluster?

### Deploy a Pod

```bash
k apply --filename resources/pod01
```

### Questions

1. How many nodes are in your Kind cluster?
2. How many nodes are in your vcluster?

### Deploy a second Pod

```bash
k apply --filename resources/pod02
```

### Questions

1. How many nodes are in your Kind cluster?
2. How many nodes are in your vcluster?

```

### Questions

```

### Questions

2. Can you explain the node assignment?

### Delete the vcluster

```bash
vcluster delete fake-nodes
```
```
info   Stopping docker proxy...
info   Delete vcluster fake-nodes...
done ‚àö Successfully deleted virtual cluster fake-nodes in namespace vcluster-fake-nodes
done ‚àö Successfully deleted virtual cluster namespace vcluster-fake-nodes
```

### Fake Nodes on Kind

When using *Kind* the difference between the host (*Kind*) cluster and the
vcluster will not be significant. The reason being, that RBAC is not a
problem on *Kind* an vcluster is able to read the nodes.

To better illustrate the difference, here is an example taken from a vcluster
running on the `sandbox` DTP tooling cluster.

#### DTP sandbox node

```bash
$ k get nodes ip-10-44-12-111.eu-central-1.compute.internal --output yaml | \
    --context dok-gitops-argo-sandbox | \
    jq '.metadata.labels'
```
```json
{
  "agentpool": "argo1",
  "beta.kubernetes.io/arch": "amd64",
  "beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type": "m6a.xlarge",
  "beta.kubernetes.io/os": "linux",

#### vcluster node one DTP sandbox

```bash
k get nodes ip-10-44-12-111.eu-central-1.compute.internal --output yaml | \
    jq '.metadata.labels'
```
```json
